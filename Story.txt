The Void
Some where, inside a <location> we find a <species> scavenging through ruble and garbage.
That <species> is called <name> and they are the only <species> left...
<name> finds a old worn out book though <name> seems to be overwhelmed by happiness..?
<name> opens the book and suddenly a dark ray strikes the exact place where <name> is standing...
<name> thinks to themselves "Its dark...I can't see anything..."
...

Suddenly out of the darkness a voice is heard it says "Little one, you seem to have found the 'The Book Of The Void', I the ruler of the void and nothingness shall give you power though it's up to you if you want to accept it..."
... (7s)
<name> asks the voice "Ruler of the void I do not believe you will give power to a mortal like me without a cost so, what is it that you seek..."
The voice replies "I only seek sacrifices every time you use the power of the void 100 foes should be killed using the power and I shall take them as a sacrifice..."
The voice asks "So, will you take up on my offer?"
... (7s)
<name> <agree> "I, <name> wish to serve 'The Ruler Of The Void' and will follow where ever the void goes..."
The voice laughs "Very well, I shall give you the power of the void and you shall be my servant form now on..."
The voice says "Now go and seek what you wish to seek with tbe power I have given you though I will help you in learning to use the newly acquired power..."
Another voice is heard and it says "I wish you had not accepted the offer of the void..."
<name> thanks the voice and wakes up on the ground the book is still in their hand...
<name> thinks to themselves "Who was the other voice from..."
